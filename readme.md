# Wheeler
### What It Does
Wheeler is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that lets people rent cars directly from other car owners. 
If you have a car that you don’t use all the time, you can list it on Wheeler and earn money. 
If you need a car for a few hours or days, you can rent one nearby quickly and easily.
### Why It Matters
Many people have cars that sit idle, while others need cars but can’t afford expensive rentals. 
Wheeler connects both sides — helping owners earn extra income and giving renters cheaper, flexible options. 
It also makes the process simple, fast, and completely digital.
### Who It’s For
- **Car owners:** who want to earn from their underused cars. 
- **Renters:** who need temporary access to cars without long paperwork or high deposits.
### Key Features
- Easy sign-up and user verification (phone number, ID, and selfie). 
- Car owners can upload photos, set prices, and manage availability. 
- Renters can search for cars by location, car type, or budget. 
- Secure payments held in escrow until the car is returned. 
- Automatic short-term insurance during rentals. 
- Ratings and reviews to build trust between users.
### Technologies (Simple Overview)
Wheeler will be built as a mobile app using web and cloud technologies that make it fast, secure, and user-friendly.
### Vision
Wheeler aims to create a world where mobility is shared, safe, and accessible — helping people move freely while reducing wasted car value.
