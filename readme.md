# Wheeler: Peer-to-Peer Car Sharing
## What Wheeler Does
Wheeler is a peer-to-peer car sharing platform that connects private car owners with people who need temporary access to a vehicle. Unlike ride-hailing services like Uber or Bolt where you hire a driver, Wheeler gives you the car itself, allowing you to decide where to go, how long to keep it, and how to use it. It's completely digital, eliminating the need for physical branches, deposits, and paperwork that traditional car rentals require.
## Why Wheeler Matters
Wheeler solves three key problems in the transportation market:
1. **Wasted Vehicle Value**: Many privately owned cars sit idle for long periods. Wheeler allows owners to monetize these underused assets.
2. **Lack of Affordable Short-term Options**: Traditional car rentals can be expensive and inflexible for short-term needs.
3. **Rental Friction**: Physical branches, paperwork, and deposits make traditional car rental inconvenient and time-consuming.
By creating a trusted digital platform, Wheeler makes car sharing simple, safe, and accessible to everyone.
## Who Wheeler Is For
Wheeler serves two primary user groups:
1. **Car Owners**: People who own vehicles that aren't in constant use and want to earn extra income by renting them out when they're not needed.
2. **Renters**: Individuals who need temporary access to a vehicle without the commitment and cost of traditional car rentals or ride-hailing services.
